# Blackhat Game
Blackhat Game is an AI game in which the player negotiates as a DeFi protocol against ChatGPT who roleplays a hacker. The goal is to recover as much funds as possible, expressed as a percentage. Each instance of the game has a provably randomly generated limit which represents the maximum amount of funds the hacker is willing to return. As the negotiator, you want the hacker to agree to return as much as possible, without pushing them over the limit.
